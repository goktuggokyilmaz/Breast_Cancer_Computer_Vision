# ðŸ§« Automated Mitosis Detection using Bag-of-Visual-Words and Classical Image Processing

This project presents a classical computer vision pipeline for detecting mitosis instances in breast cancer histopathological images. It combines background segmentation, handcrafted features, and a Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model with a Random Forest classifier to automate mitotic figure identification.

## Introduction

Mitotic figures in breast cancer histology slides are key indicators of tumor proliferation. Manual counting is time-consuming and inconsistent. This project proposes a low-resource automated detection approach using classical image processing and machine learning techniques.

---

## Dataset

We use breast cancer histopathology slides from five patients (A00â€“A04). Each image is 2084 Ã— 2084 pixels and comes with CSV annotations of mitosis coordinates.

- **Train**: A01, A03, A04  
- **Validation**: A02  
- **Test**: A00

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. Preprocessing & Segmentation

- Convert image to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur.
- Segment regions that are significantly darker than the local mean intensity using adaptive thresholding.
- Apply morphological operations (opening, closing, dilation) to clean up noise and isolate nuclei.

### 2. Feature Extraction

Each segmented cell region is represented by a hybrid feature vector containing:

- **Texture Features**: LBP, GLCM (contrast, energy, homogeneity, correlation)
- **Shape Features**: Aspect ratio, solidity, perimeter, circularity
- **Color Features**: Mean and std in HSV space
- **BoVW Histogram**: Using SIFT descriptors clustered into 100 visual words via KMeans

### 3. Classification

- Random Forest Classifier with class balancing:
  ```python
  RandomForestClassifier(
      n_estimators=200,
      max_depth=20,
      min_samples_leaf=3,
      min_samples_split=4,
      class_weight="balanced"
  )

## Results

The performance of the proposed mitosis detection pipeline was evaluated using two main metrics:

- **F1 Score**: Measures the balance between precision and recall for mitosis classification.
- **Pixel-wise Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Evaluates spatial overlap between predicted mitosis regions and ground truth annotations.

### Validation Set Results (A02)

| Class        | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Non-Mitotic  | 0.99      | 1.00   | 0.99     |
| Mitotic      | 0.42      | 0.21   | 0.28     |

- **Overall F1 Score**: `0.278`  
- **IoU (A02 - Validation Set)**: `0.1089`

### Test Set Results (A00)

- **IoU (A00 - Test Set)**: `0.2627`

Despite the highly imbalanced dataset and the challenges of detecting small, diverse mitotic figures, the model was able to generalize moderately well on unseen data. The results show potential for practical use in assisting manual diagnosis, especially with further refinements.
